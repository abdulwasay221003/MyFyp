Health Deterioration Detection Model
==================================================

PURPOSE: Detect health DETERIORATION from past trends
NOT future prediction - just pattern detection!

APPROACH: 100% UNSUPERVISED
- No manual labels
- No future value prediction
- Model learns normal patterns from FitBit data

INPUT: Past 7 days of watch data
OUTPUT:
  1. Deterioration Status (Normal/Mild/Severe)
  2. Anomaly Score
  3. Trend Analysis (slopes)

MODELS USED:
  1. Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)
  2. K-Means Clustering (Pattern Grouping)

FEATURES (per variable):
  - Mean, Std, Slope, Change Rate, Recent Value, Consistency
